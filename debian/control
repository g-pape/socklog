Description: small and secure replacement for syslogd
 socklog cooperates with the runit package to create a small and secure
 replacement for syslogd.  socklog supports system logging through Unix
 domain sockets (/dev/log) and UDP sockets (0.0.0.0:514) with the help of
 runit's runsvdir, runsv, and svlogd.  socklog provides a different
 network logging concept, and also does log event notification.  svlogd
 has built in log file rotation based on file size, so there is no need
 for any cron jobs to rotate the logs.  socklog is small, secure, and
 reliable.
