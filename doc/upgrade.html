<h1>socklog - upgrading from previous versions</h1>
<hr>

<h3>0.6.0 or 0.6.1 to 0.7.0</h3>
There are mostly internal changes, no further actions from you are required.
<hr>
<h3>0.5.1 to 0.6.0 or 0.6.1</h3>
The socklog-notify service run-script now redirects uncat's standard output
to the notify pipe. This avoids wrong timeout handling seen in some special
configurations. If you are currently running the socklog-notify service,
change the line <b><tt>exec &gt; "$PIPE"</tt></b> to
<b><tt>exec &lt;&gt; "$PIPE"</tt></b> in
<tt>/service/socklog-notify/run</tt> and restart the service:
<pre>
  # svc -t /service/socklog-notify
</pre>
The socklog program now trims 0-characters. If you see 0-characters in your
socklog log files (most probably caused by klogd on GNU/Linux), restart the
corresponding socklog service, e.g.:
<pre>
  # svc -t /service/socklog-unix/
</pre>
The package/install-man script creates symbolic links for the man pages
into the /usr/local/man/ hierarchy on installation. The uncat program
has a new option -o.
<hr>
<h3>0.4.0 or 0.4.1 to 0.5.1</h3>
The named pipe for log events notification has now more strict permissions
for security reasons. It is recommended to upgrade this service if it is
running by stopping it, removing /etc/socklog/notify and
/var/log/socklog/.notify and recreating the service, following the
instructions.
<p>
The socklog program is now run by softlimit, you may consider adapting your
run scripts.
