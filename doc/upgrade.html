<h1>socklog - upgrading from previous versions</h1>
<hr>
<h3>1.0.0 to 1.1.0 or 1.1.1</h3>
The socklog package now cooperates with the runit package instead of the
daemontools package to provide syslog services.
If you don't want to change your current configuration to utilize the
programs from the runit package, you don't need to upgrade.
If you want to upgrade nonetheless, but still use the programs from the
daemontools package, no further action from you but installing the new
socklog version is required.
<p>
If you want to switch your configuration to utilize the runit package, you
need to re-create your service directories using the
<a href="socklog-conf.8.html">socklog-conf</a> program.
