<h1>socklog - upgrading from previous versions</h1>
<hr>
<h2>0.4.0 or 0.4.1 to 0.5.1</h2>
The named pipe for log events notification has now more strict permissions
for security reasons. It is recommended to upgrade this service if it is
running by stopping it, removing /etc/socklog/notify and
/var/log/socklog/.notify and recreating the service, following the
instructions.
<p>
The socklog program is now run by softlimit, you may consider adapting your
run scripts.
